## In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
- Describe is used to group together a set of tests associated with one thing. Describe is a great tool for organizing.
  it() is interchangeable with jest's test() method. Essentially it allows us to describe and run a specific test we want.

## What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
- The point of TDD is to eliminate future bugs during development and then later as legacy code. By wiring in tests we are not only seeing our code function properly during development but also building alarms to warn future developers. 
- I think TDD is really useful for when we tackle a large project, but when it comes to small apps it's not always something I would use. However, I do see the power of it and plan to start implementing a TDD style more often.

## Mention three types of automated tests.
- unit tests
- integration tests
- component test
